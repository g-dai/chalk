          <div class="article-content">
            <p>It has been almost a month since the Bay Area shelter-in-place order has been issued, and I’ve been at home for the most part.</p>

<p>I’ve spent a lot of time reflecting and doing some personal writing. It’s truly been insightful and I’m very thankful I have the time to pause and really take a look at myself, where I am, and where I’m headed. To give some context to my situation: I am quarantined in my Oakland apartment with two roommates (although one just came back from spending time with her family nearby).</p>

<p>Here are some things I’ve learned from all the time I’ve spent with myself:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>I love how much time I have for myself now.</strong> I seem to have more motivation to do things when I have a set routine and time spent being alone. Seeing how much I have been able to do in this time has really been an eye-opener for me, and simultaneously has taught me how much I should value and guard my time.
This is what a typical day for me looks like:
    <ul>
      <li>Wake up between 6-7am, have a coffee and read a book</li>
      <li>Exercise and shower (~1 hour total)</li>
      <li>Work on my senior project till lunch, around 11:30am-12pm. No online messaging before this.</li>
      <li>Have lunch, then do more work, read, draw, journal, or do another hobby (more relaxed state of productivity)</li>
      <li>Have dinner, “</li>
      <li>Go to bed around 10-10:30pm, usually with a 10 minute meditation session beforehand.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Limiting my social interactions (both physically due to quarantine, and online through my routine) allowed me to realize that I don’t need to worry about constantly staying in touch with friends - or rather, worry that I will lose what I value in my relationships if I am not constantly in contact. In regards to my fear of losing people close to me: <strong>what exactly am I losing, if the foundation my relationships are built upon is of me giving too much of myself?</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Going off #2, I find myself also being much more present when I do spend time with my friends - I feel less pressure that I am socializing instead of “being productive”, because I actually designate much more time in my day to be productive. That being said, <strong>being more intentional with my time overall has greatly improved my presence in anything I’m doing</strong> (although it’s definitely still a work in progress!).</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Acknowledging the good things and the silver linings truly makes a difference in difficult times</strong>. It’s really important to recognize what I have. I was feeling quite low a few days back, and after writing down my gratitudes, I felt physically so much better. A few things I am grateful for:
    <ul>
      <li>That I am well, both physically, mentally, and resource-wise</li>
      <li>That my loving family is safe, back home in Canada</li>
      <li>That I have very caring friends who check in on me and who I regularly have conversations with</li>
      <li>That I have a wonderful and supportive boyfriend - his amazingness has really been able to shine more visibly in dark times</li>
      <li>That I am able to do the things I love and stay very motivated</li>
      <li>That I was able to secure a job as an international student during a pandemic</li>
      <li>That I’m learning all these things about myself and can focus on personal growth
One of my core beliefs is that nothing is ever black and white. One example I can give is that my boyfriend had to go back to Canada abruptly when the shelter-in-place order was issued - no one was expecting how fast things were changing. It was upsetting because we had plans to spend more time together (in fact we cancelled a weekend trip too), and I don’t know exactly when I’ll be seeing him next. But our long-distance has brought forth very beautiful moments. For example, this morning we had a virtual yoga and reading session together. It was such a precious moment - I wouldn’t have known moments like these could exist if COVID hadn’t hit; that we are able to overcome difficult situations, find alternative ways of spending time together, and still be truly happy.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>I can’t control the world around me, but I can control how I respond to it.</strong> I am currently reading <em>Meditations</em> by Marcus Aurelius (I highly, highly recommend this to anyone, especially when they are feeling a lot of distress - this was the exact recommendation given by my highschool history professor, and I couldn’t agree more). One of the sentences that really stood out to me is:
    <blockquote>
      <p>The Universe is change, life is opinion.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>I think this quote is so relevant to the current situation. We are suffering collectively from this virus; but on an individual level, we can take actions to do the best we can, even if we aren’t our best selves. Creating a routine, taking time to reflect, focusing on hobbies or learning a new skill… Something small that I did and saw drastic change in my mental wellbeing is to limit how often I look at news.</p>

<p>I still have much more to uncover about myself. I look forward to more solitude and reflecting!</p>
