It has been almost a month since the Bay Area shelter-in-place order has been issued, and I've been at home for the most part.

I've spent a lot of time reflecting and doing some personal writing. It's truly been insightful and I'm very thankful I have the time to pause and really take a look at myself, where I am, and where I'm headed. To set a

Here are some things I've learned from all the time I've spent with myself:

1. I love how much time I have for myself now. I seem to have more motivation to do things when I have a set routine and time spent being alone.

- Have lunch, then do more work, read, draw, or do another hobby (more relaxed state of productivity)
- Have dinner, "
- Go to bed around 10-10:30pm.

Limiting my social interactions (both physically due to quarantine, and online through my routine) allowed me to realize that I don't need to worry about constantly staying in touch with friends - or rather, worry that I will lose what I value in my relationships if I am not constantly in contact. In regards to my fear of losing people close to me: what exactly am I losing, if the foundation my relationships are built upon is of me giving too much of myself?

3. Going off #2, I find myself also being much more present when I do spend time with my friends - I feel less pressure that I am socializing instead of "being productive", because I actually designate much more time in my day to be productive. That being said, being more intentional with my time overall has greatly improved my presence in anything I'm doing (although it's definitely still a work in progress!).
